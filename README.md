# Bomb Lab
Course project for Computer Systems Fundamentals.

## Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the Bomb Lab, a problem-solving exercise focused on reverse engineering and debugging techniques. The goal of this project is to successfully defuse a virtual bomb by analyzing the program and understanding its logic using the GNU Debugger (gdb). There are six phases, each requiring a correct input to proceed. A single mistake will "detonate" the bomb.  

This assignment was submitted on October 7, 2024 through GitHub Classroom.
